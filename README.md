## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS3
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned the basics of CCS custom properties for this one. Also learned a bit more about the box-shadow property.

### Continued development

This challenge featured a little more responsivity than the last (the profile card component), but I still haven't done much beyond changing flex-direction and shrinking widths. So I definitely want to get some more experience with Flexbox in the future. And while I'm happy with the results, I'm sure there are things I can do to improve my actual CSS, including implementing custom properties better and just streamlining everything.

### Useful resources
